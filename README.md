Table 1. Comparative results between Hough transform and our method using KITTI data set. Three well known
metrics are used in experiments: pixel based Intersection of Union (IoU), purity and accuracy. The upper part of the
table shows three arbitrary samples and the remaining part shows the average performance of 148 samples
